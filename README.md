# Coffee Shop App
# Description
A coffee shop or cafe is a restaurant that offers limited coffee of different sorts, such as cappuccino, latte, and espresso. Most coffee shops may provide chilled drinks including cold brew, iced coffee, as well as other non-caffeinated refreshments. Coffee has become one of the most popular drinks in the world. Aside from freshwater, some believe it will be the most extensively drank beverage throughout the entire globe. The Coffee Shop app values customer satisfaction and provides a user-friendly environment for customers. It will be a sanctuary of peace and leisure for anybody wishing to gradually depart from life's everyday hardships.
# Features
1. Ordering coffee:
Implementing a pre-ordering function in the app, effectively allows customers to bypass the line and have his\her coffee scalding hot, fresh, and prepared for them when they arrive or ready to deliver at the doorstep.
2. Notification:
By implementing this feature, your app's system can identify people who have downloaded your app and appear near your coffee outlet. Therefore, your app can send invitations and welcome messages to these customers and offer them some discounts or offers.
3. App payments:
Apps that enable users to connect digital payments have become extremely prevalent as we progress into a digital world. App payments make payment systems easier to use and do not need the appropriate currency on hand, and neither does it necessitates customers to go through their wallets again for the correct mode of payment.
4. Find location:
They'll instantly be able to check whether your coffee company does have cafes in their near region by using their personalized device, so there is little question they'd just get out of their manner to obtain their favorite beverage.
5. Digital Menu:
Presenting your catalog with all the commodities and associated pricing is indeed a terrific way to show off the variety of your cafe. Make sure to include a brief overview of components for every item so that customers can quickly comprehend what they should get.
6. Cart:
Customer should have added their favorite coffee items first and then go for further processing to purchase online and have their beverages at their doorstep. 
7. Description:
The added product description were shown on the cart page.
8. Delete:
Customers can also erase their baskets if they do not like the products or have some issues.
9. Profile Change:
With a work profile you can securely and privately use the same device for work and personal purposes—your organization manages your work apps and data while your personal apps, data, and usage remain private.
# What your application does:
For this assignment, coffee shop(e-commerce) apps were implemented which helps to increase customer loyalty (and boost sales and revenue as a result), and apps are one of the most effective ways of developing a sense of belonging and community among their clientele. With a custom app, coffee shops can reward their customers, speed up proceedings (which is a surefire way of keeping clients happy), and keep in touch with their clientele to develop the communal feel of the business.
# Why do you use the technologies you used?
1. Vs studio, Flutter SDK, Dev Tools, and Android Studio technologies are used in this project to build a Coffee Shop application.It helps to build high-performance, Increase developer agility and productivity. Streamline every stage of development with tools and resources to support developers as they build the next generation
of apps. Android Studio helps to get new features and enhancement suggestions over the eclipse termed as Android Development Tools ADT.For the backend MongoDB and NodeJS were implemented:
2. MongoDB is more scalable and streamlines data connections. MongoDB is ideal for inserting data quickly. We find it incredibly handy for saving reports and metadata because it can dump the JSON it receives without explicitly defining every feature. I use it for this assignment to build a coffee shop website because of the versatility it offers – users shouldn't have to declare any structure or deal with migrations, for example. It's very efficient for many instances. MongoDB offers scalability, making it an ideal choice for several businesses. 
3. Node.js is a development tool that is extremely fast, elevated, and lightweight, making it perfect for reactive side programming. Node.js allows you to do several activities at the same time. Furthermore, you may use serverless and choose from a variety of cloud computing models and providers, such as Amazon Web Service or Google Cloud Platform.
# Challenges You Faced and Features You Hope To Implement In The Future.
While doing the task many challenges occurred. Some of them are as follows:
1. Firstly, the emulator crashed while running the code.
2. Adv was not supported.
3. The product was not showing in the dashboard with no error.
4. The laptop is not working while launching the emulator.
5. The notification was not showing.

There are some of the features that will be implemented in the future.
1. Support multiple payment options.
2. Custom Branding.
3. Social media integration.
4. Rating and Feedback.
5. Easy Checkout.
6. Wishlist Button.
# Project Architeture
The pattern that is followed for this project is the MVC pattern which helps the controller handle the entire request from the client and will tell the rest of the server what to do with the request it acts as a middleman between the model and view. With this controller receives a request is asked the model for information based on the request and model is responsible for handling all the data logic of a request. So that the model interacts with the database and handles all validation saving updating deleting etc. of the data. The controller never has to worried about how to handle the data it responds based on what the model returns.
# Conclusion
Flutter framework will undoubtedly enable many new developers to develop high-performance and feature-rich mobile applications soon by providing simplicity in the development process, high performance in the resulting mobile application and a rich and relevant user interface for both Android and iOS platforms. The results showed that the application was assessed adequately by the respondents in terms of user acceptability, productivity, maintainability, portability, quality, and reliability.
